## Usage

### Desktop
1. Copy formatted text from anywhere (`Ctrl+C` / `⌘C`)
2. Paste into the app (`Ctrl+V` / `⌘V`)
3. Markdown appears — already selected, ready to copy

Paste again to replace. Switch flavors to re-convert on the fly.

### Mobile
1. Long-press text anywhere → **Copy**
2. Tap **Paste from Clipboard** in the app  
   *(or long-press in the dashed zone → tap **Paste**)*
3. Markdown appears — tap **Copy** to grab it

If the app detects clipboard content on load, a banner appears to paste with one tap.
